                    <h2>1% BETTER EVERY DAY</h2>
                    <p>Habits are the compound interest of self‑improvement.The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and  yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.
                    This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.</p>

                    <h2>WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE</h2>
                        <p>It  is  so  easy to  overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth‑shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how  the  math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty‑seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.

                    <h2>WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE</h2>
                    <p>Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty‑five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up. Twenty‑six degrees. Twenty‑seven. Twenty‑eight. The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you. Twenty‑nine degrees. Thirty. Thirty‑one.Still, nothing has happened.Then, thirty‑two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one‑degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.</p>

                    <h2>FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD</h2>
                    <p>Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and  family is to set specific, actionable goals. For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.</p>
                    <p>What’s the difference between systems and goals?	It’s a distinction I first learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist	behind the Dilbert comic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that	lead to	those results.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If	you’re a coach,	your goal might	be to win a	championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.<li> If you’re an	entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a milliondollar business. Your system is	how	you	test product ideas,	hire employees,	and	run	marketing campaigns. <li> If you’re	a musician,	your goal might	be to play a new piece. Your system	is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback	from your instructor.</ul>

                    <h2>A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS</h2>
                    <p>If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The  problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 % improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building  blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.</p>
